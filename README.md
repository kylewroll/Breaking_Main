Description: Description of project, capabilties, bug, etc

This project creates a simple paint window that the user can doodle in. It offers the ability to change the brush colors to black, red, blue, or green, and can also change the 
brush size to be narrow, wide, or a large circle. Lastly, there's a clear button that will remove all of the lines on the canvas. All formatting options are located in dropdown boxes that are set by default to display the value at 0. I tried to modify this
using the IsSynchronizedWithSelectedItem boolean, but it wasn't working the way that I had hoped, so I left it. As a result, you can click on the buttons to modify the brush, and
they will take effect, but the button displayed in the combo box will always be the default settings.

I had also hoped to make a little combination of buttons that would allow you to increase or decrease the brush size by one, for more precise brushes, which required access to the 
default drawing attributes, to display the current size of the brush to the user, but I couldn't figure out how to access the data to display on the canvas screen, so I replaced
the precision brush in favor of adding the narrow brush and wide brush options for some more choices.

Granted, these problems are likely something I can fix pretty quickly with some more time and experimentation, but the project has enough in it for the time being and I don't want
focues so much on trying to implement these smaller things that I forget to actually hand in the assignment, so I might test some more on my own, but it would either be in a 
copy of this project, or after the project has been graded.

I honestly expected this to take a lot longer than it did, I had planned for needed a day or two too sort everything out, but it really only took me an afternoon, which was 
pleasant, and I actually found myself enjoying thinking up all of the things the I could do, even though I opted for something simple just to meet the requirements, at least for
the time being.
